# Game-of-Life
`Conway's Game of Life 
`

>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
>The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

`Planned Stuffs
`
- [ ] Complete this readme with screenshots, description etc.
- [ ] Implement user interface
- [ ] Add more control (speed, undo etc.)
- [ ] Allow user setup custom initial state.
- [ ] Release stable program


`Note`

This is a simple program and are not meant to be use professionally. There are much better program [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/golly/).
