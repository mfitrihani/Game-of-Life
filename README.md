# Game-of-Life
`Conway's Game of Life 
`

>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
>The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

`Planned Stuffs
`
- [x] Implement user interface
- [x] Allow initial state to be read from text file
- [x] Revise code(it's messy)
- [ ] Add more control (speed,pause, undo etc.)(ongoing)
- [ ] Allow initial state to be read from ire file
- [ ] Add more pattern
- [ ] Implement more nicer ui
- [ ] Release stable program


`Note`

This is a simple program and are not meant to be use professionally. There are much better program [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/golly/).
